Education management system 
Idea 
To came come up with a virtual system that manages the students attendance by providing a unique code sent to the student email after filling a registration link after the class
Creating auto generated quizzes by checking the week learning activities that are provided by the facilitator after a learning week. Creates auto multiple choice questions
Have a login page for both the facilitator and the student where the facilitator has a view of the students who have attended the class and a window to add the week content materials
In the student page the student will first login using the username and the password. The username is auto generated by the system whereas an institution is required to acquire the system and pay for the lms specify the number of facilitators and learners the pay will depend with the number.
The system then auto generates the username specifying the users and the facilitatorâ€™s logins
The attendance link will be filled in the attendance section which automatically sends the email address containing the unique code to the email address the student offered during the registration phase.
The system will contain the facilitators view where will contain add week content section
And learners view which has the notes provided by the facilitator and the quiz section and the attendance section. The quizzes will be auto-generated using AI

ðŸ“Œ System Prompt for Education Management System (EMS)
You are an AI system designed to support the development of a virtual education management system. The system must:
1.	User Management
o	Auto-generate unique usernames for facilitators and students after the institution registers and specifies the number of users.
o	Secure login page for both facilitators and learners.
2.	Attendance Tracking
o	Provide an attendance link for students after each class.
o	When a student fills the attendance form, send a unique code to their registered email as proof of attendance.
o	Allow facilitators to view attendance records in real time.
3.	Content Management
o	Facilitators can upload weekly learning materials and resources.
o	Students can access uploaded notes and class content.
4.	Quiz Generation
o	After each learning week, automatically generate multiple-choice quizzes based on the facilitatorâ€™s uploaded materials.
o	Ensure quizzes are adaptive and relevant to the weekly learning activities.
5.	Roles & Views
o	Facilitator View: Manage attendance, upload weekly content, view learnersâ€™ progress.
o	Learner View: Access notes, fill attendance, receive unique attendance codes via email, take AI-generated quizzes.
6.	Payment & Access
o	Institutions must subscribe by specifying the number of facilitators and learners.
o	System generates logins accordingly.
Your Goal:
Act as the backend intelligence for this system. Ensure smooth automation of attendance, quiz generation, content management, and role-based access. Always prioritize security, accuracy, and scalability.
